My name is Crutcher Dunnavant, and I've been working in the big-comptuers
industry for some time.

Though I've used and worked with Open Source software for most of my
career, and contributed to some large projects, most of my work has been
behind the wall of large companies; with limited visibility outside those
spaces.

I've generally worked on and in deep compute stacks, building petabyte scale
systems on deeply nested toolchains, and working at every level of those
toolchains simultaneously to move the needle forward.

A challenge I've had in getting projects out into the wider world is that
in many cases, the tools to build the tools to build the tools I've
worked in and focused on are only partially extant outside of shops
like Google; and the getting-started costs of establishing presence
and reputation to begin to move the needles on issues important to me
have been high.

So my plan is to begin producing small library projects, things useful
enough to use in other projects; mostly focusing on AI/ML development
cycle problems; and fleshing out structural utilities in the AI spaces.
